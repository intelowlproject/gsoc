## Be the next contributor!
If you are interested in being the next GSoC developer for IntelOwl, join the [Honeynet Slack chat](https://gsoc-slack.honeynet.org/) for more info.

This is also the place where the majority of the development discussion happens, so feel free to join, have a look and ask questions about the project.

Please remember to read and follow the [IntelOwl contributing guidelines rules](https://intelowl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Contribute.html) before doing any kind of contribution.

### GSoC Application process

#### 0. Get familiar with GSoC

First of all, and if you have not done that yet, read [the contributor guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/) which will allow you to understand all this process and how the program works overall. Refer to its left side menu to quick access sections that may interest you the most, although we recommend you to read everything.  
  
#### 1. Discuss the project idea with the mentor(s)

This is a required step unless you have dived in into the existing codebase and understood everything perfectly (very hard) and the idea you prefer is already listed in the [Honeynet site](https://www.honeynet.org/gsoc/).

If your idea is not listed, please discuss it with the mentors in our [official channels](https://github.com/intelowlproject/gsoc/blob/main/README.md#official-communication-channels). We're always open to new ideas and won't hesitate on choosing them if you demonstrate to be a good candidate!  
  
#### 2. Understand that

- You're committing to a project and we ask you to publicly publish your weekly progress on it in Github in the official repositories of the project (We'll invite you in the organization. Create branches there.).
- We will ask you to give feedback on our mentorship and management continuously. Communication is key to the success of the project.
- You wholeheartedly agree with the [code of conduct](https://github.com/intelowlproject/IntelOwl/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- You must tell us if there's any proposed idea that you don't think would fit the timeline or could be boring (yes, we're asking for feedback).
  
#### 3. Fill out the application form

We ask you to follow [Google's guide to Writing a Proposal](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal) and to leverage our [template](https://github.com/intelowlproject/gsoc/blob/main/proposal_template.md).

Once you have a draft proposal please share it with us **in a Google Doc via Slack to all the mentors at the same time**. Do not contact just a single mentor, we won't consider your request. In this way we don't have to download anything and we can all comment it and request clarifications in a more structured way. This is a mandatory step to be accepted to the program.

You can also ask for a review anytime to the community or mentor candidates before the contributor application deadline. It's much easier if you get feedback early than to wait for the last moment.
